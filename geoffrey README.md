-Hi there wave
-My name is Geoffrey. Welcome to my Github!

-I am a full-stack web developer. I recently graduated from Jomo Kenyatta university in Health Informatics and decided to make a bigger leap to learn programming.
 I spend a lot of time brainstorming ideas and always try to create something.

- My motivation for coding is fairly simple and it's somewhat related to my college major.  
 I learned web developing because I want to code for good. 
 Web developing is very versatile and is one of the most common and fast-growing demand skills. 
 I would like to be the go-to person among friends or anyone who needs a website. 
 You'll find me constantly learning new technologies and that's what I love about the tech community. 
 It's hard to get sick of it and I can talk about it all day long.
 
 Technical skills: Javascript, ReactJS, Ruby On Rails, Ruby, Git, mySQL
 
- seedling Iâ€™m learning React Hooks, Jest/Enzyme test
- dancers I want to be better at website designs and building backend API disguised_face.
